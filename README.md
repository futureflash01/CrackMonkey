# CrackMonkey

CrackMonkey Remastered (CMR) is a program that cracks and extracts the encrypted password for the 'data.jet' file in BTD Battles. This program is only intended for modding purposes only, however I do not condone modding in any way! Use at your own risk!
If you result in your BTD Battles account getting banned, I do not take responsibility!

P.S: It's called remastered because I tried making this program a few years ago and I forgot about it. Also, this program is a successor to 'BTDPassExtractor' which was a program I made that was used by a lot of Redditors in the BTD Modding community!
